        <p>Hello! I'm David Hall and I'm a Web-Developer. My interactive portfolio will take you through my journey from coding novice to where I am today.
          Scroll down and let's build something! </p>
      </div>
      <div class="first">
        <p>Ah, such humble beginings. Fruit Fight is my first solo project as well as my first foray into manipulating a webpage using JQuery.
        Here I learned how to manipulate the DOM and really make a webpage come alive. Use funky fruit artillery to blow up your opponent before they
        get you!</p>

        <p>I love how coding builds upon what came before to create ever more complex and intresting right now we just have a wisp of smoke. I wonder what we can do with it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="second">
        <p>Well that was fast! Our wisp of smoke has become....well more smoke. Lets come back to that...</p>

        <p>Enter databases. Frontend and Backend didn't truly mean much to me until Expanded Pokedex.  Built with MongoDB and Express, EP expanded
        what I was able to do exponentially and allowed my to save data from an API for later use.</p>

        <p>Now about this pile of smoke, I think what we need now is some movement...keep scrolling!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="third">
        <p>Thats more like it! Bit by bit, it is our little wisp is turning into something worth looking at. So many wisps working in concert, sounds like metaphore...</p>

        <p>Four heads are better than one and React is better than....not React. Plot Master is the product of a collabrative effort for three other
          wonderful developers and friends. Built with MongoDB and React, this garden plot tool allows you to plan a vegetable garden and provides
          tons of useful information about each plant.</p>

        <p>I like the layers, I like the motion, but the ball is still looking a little monochromatic. Cue lights!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourth">
        <p>Pretty! I'm sure what it is anymore but thats half the fun!</p>

        <p>Now we are cooking with gas. Better Recipes is built with Rails and React and is the first App I've made that I use on a regular basis.
        A huge recipe database, no ads, costumizable timers and all recipe instructions, ingredients, and ammounts in one place.</p>

        <p>I don't know about you but our smokey, swirly blob is feeling a little predictable....</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fifth">
        <p>Enter lightning!</p>
        <p>Inspired by my family, for my family. Wirhal Family Utilties. At the moment, there are only a handfull of apps availible but one day
          this "Franken App" with be as wild and diverse as my crazy family. Each app presented its own challenge to overcome and really tested everything
        I've learned.</p>
        <p>Well, we went from a single wisp to a technocolored lightning ball.  It was a fun journey but can that really be it! Nah, try moving your cursor
          to the lower right hand side of the screen.</p>
