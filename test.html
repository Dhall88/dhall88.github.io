        <p>Hello! I'm David Wirhal and welcome to my ineractive portfolio! Scroll down through my timeline and lets build something!<p>
      </div>
      <div class="first">
        <p>Ah, such humble beginings. Fruit Fight is my first solo project as well as my first foray into manipulating a webpage using JQuery.
        Here I learned how to manipulate the DOM and really make a webpage come alive. Use funky fruit artillery to blow up your opponent before they
        get you!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="second">
        <p>Enter databases. Frontend and Backend didn't truly mean much to me until Expanded Pokedex.  Built with MongoDB and Express, EP expanded
        what I was able to do exponentially and allowed my to save data from an API for later use.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="third">
        <p>Four heads are better than one and React is better than....not React. Plot Master is the product of a collabrative effort for three other
          wonderful developers and friends. Built with MongoDB and React, this garden plot tool allows you to plan our a vegetable garden and provides
          tons of useful information about each plant.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourth">
        <p>Now we are cooking with gas! Better Recipes is built with Rails and React and is the first App I've made that I use on a regular basis.
        A huge recipe database, no ads, costumizable timers and all recipe instructions, ingredients, and ammounts in one place.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fifth">
        <p>Inspired by my family, for my family. Wirhal Family Utilties. At the moment, there are only a handfull of apps availible but one day
          this "Franken App" with be as wild and diverse as my crazy family. Each app presented its own challenge to overcome and really tested everything
        I've learned.</p>
