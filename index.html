        <p>Humble Beginings indeed. My first project utilized jQuery to create a tank artillary game. Use different types of fruit artillary to blow up your opponent before they get you!</p>

        <p>I love how coding builds upon what came before to create ever more complex and intresting objects. Right now we just have a wisp of smoke. I wonder what we can do with it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="second">
        <p>Well that was fast! Our wisp of smoke has become a big black cloud.</p>

        <p>Just as that single wisp can be layered into a more complex feature, the addition of databases can be layered into apps to give the apps a memory.  Expanded Pokedex allows the user to search
          through a exaustive list of pokemon and add your favorites to your dream team. Thanks to MongoDB, that data doesn't just disapear on refresh!</p>

        <p>As for our cloud, its looking a bit static...</p>
      </div>
      <div class="third">
        <p>Thats more like it! Bit by bit, it is our little wisp is turning into something worth looking at. So many wisps working in concert, sounds a bit like a metaphore...</p>

        <p>A powerful metaphore at that.  Plot Master is the product of a collabrative effort
          with three other wonderful developers and friends. Built with MongoDB and React, this garden plot tool allows you to plan a vegetable garden and provides
          tons of useful information about each plant.</p>

        <p>As for our ball of smoke. I like the layers, I like the motion, but the ball is still looking a little monochromatic...</p>

        <p>Pretty!</p>

        <p>Better Recipes is built with Rails and React and is the first App I've made that I use on a regular basis.
        A huge recipe database, no ads, costumizable timers and all recipe instructions, ingredients, and amounts in one place.</p>

        <p>Inspired by my family, for my family, welcome to Wirhal Family Utilties. At the moment, there are only a handfull of apps available but one day
          this "Franken App" with be as wild and diverse as my crazy family. Each app presented its own challenge to overcome and really tested everything
        I've learned.</p>

        <p>Programming is facinating for a countless of reasons, but that I particularly enjoy is modularity.  A single structure can have a completely different
          feel with a few minor changes to styling. Move your mouse toward the right side of the screen to make our swirling thundercloud a bit more....macho?</p>
